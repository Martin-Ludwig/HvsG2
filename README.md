**Hero vs Gegner 2 - PSP Homebrew Game - 2012**

HvsG2 is a fast active time battle game developed around 2012.


Its best to run on a orignal psp go.
Unplayable on pc, because time is dependend on frames. A lot of dirty code.

My second game on the HvsG series. The prequel must be somewhere on a dusty hard drive.
